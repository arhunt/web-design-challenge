Submission of Homework 11 Latitude Analysis Dashboard

Dashboard created from re-running a previous assignment and using the resulting CSV and image files to create a site describing the analysis:

* Main page describing the project
* Comparison pages showing all four plots in large format: All Cities, Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere
* Visualization pages for all plots: Max Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed
* Data page showing all data points gathered during the analysis and from which the plots were created.
